In this research, we investigate how herbivory patterns influence the delivery of critical ecosystem services in tropical seagrass ecosystems, including carbon sequestration, coastal protection, and fisheries support. We demonstrate that moderate grazing pressure enhances ecosystem service delivery by maintaining seagrass productivity and diversity, while excessive herbivory can compromise service provision. Our findings reveal complex trade-offs between different services under varying grazing regimes, providing evidence-based guidance for managing herbivore populations to optimize the multiple benefits that seagrass ecosystems provide to coastal communities and global climate regulation.
