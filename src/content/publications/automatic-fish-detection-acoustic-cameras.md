In this study, we develop breakthrough automatic fish detection methods using acoustic camera technology, significantly advancing underwater monitoring capabilities in challenging aquatic environments. We demonstrate that acoustic imaging systems can successfully detect and track fish in turbid waters where traditional optical methods fail, using machine learning algorithms to process acoustic signatures. Our innovative approach provides reliable fish detection with 85% accuracy across diverse species and environmental conditions, offering new possibilities for non-invasive monitoring in rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters where visibility is limited.
