In this study, we examine functional changes in reef systems under ocean warming conditions, focusing on the asymmetrical effects of altered grazing behavior by crustacean mesograzers on primary producer communities. Using controlled temperature experiments, we demonstrate that warming disproportionately affects grazing intensity and selectivity, leading to shifts in algal community composition and reef function. Our findings reveal that climate change impacts on key herbivore species can cascade through reef food webs, fundamentally altering ecosystem processes and highlighting the vulnerability of reef systems to warming-induced changes in species interactions.
