We developed an automated fish counting system for baited underwater video stations (BRUVS) that achieved 88% accuracy in counting Australasian snapper across varying densities. Our deep learning approach successfully addressed the challenge of fish obscuration in high-density scenarios, providing a cost-effective alternative to manual video analysis. This automated method offers substantial potential for improving the efficiency and statistical rigor of fishery-independent monitoring programs used in stock assessment.
