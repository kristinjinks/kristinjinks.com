In this research, we demonstrate how habitat connectivity enhances herbivory patterns and ecosystem functioning in disturbed marine environments, revealing the adaptive benefits of well-connected ecological networks. Using laboratory experiments across connectivity gradients, we show that well-connected habitats maintain higher and more consistent herbivory rates even under disturbance conditions, leading to improved primary productivity and ecosystem stability. Our findings provide compelling evidence that connectivity acts as an insurance mechanism against disturbance impacts, enabling ecosystems to maintain critical ecological processes through enhanced species movement and resource flows between habitat patches.
