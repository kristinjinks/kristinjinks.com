In this research, we examine how different types of disturbances interact with habitat connectivity to influence ecosystem resilience across marine environments. Using experimental and observational approaches, we demonstrate that the relationship between connectivity and resilience is highly dependent on disturbance type, with pulse disturbances (e.g., storms) showing different connectivity-resilience relationships compared to press disturbances (e.g., chronic sedimentation). Our findings reveal that well-connected habitats can either enhance or reduce resilience depending on whether connectivity facilitates recovery or spreads disturbance effects, providing critical insights for adaptive ecosystem management under changing environmental conditions.
